 *
 * Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set
 * bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 11
 *
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 128
 *
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 2147483645
 *
 * Output: 30
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of
 * thirty set bits.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
 *
 *
 *
 * Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
