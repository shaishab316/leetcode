 * Testcase Example:  '"successes"'
 *
 * You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters ('a' to
 * 'z').
 *
 * Your task is to:
 *
 *
 * Find the vowel (one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u') with the maximum
 * frequency.
 * Find the consonant (all other letters excluding vowels) with the maximum
 * frequency.
 *
 *
 * Return the sum of the two frequencies.
 *
 * Note: If multiple vowels or consonants have the same maximum frequency, you
 * may choose any one of them. If there are no vowels or no consonants in the
 * string, consider their frequency as 0.
 * The frequency of a letter x is the number of times it occurs in the
 * string.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: s = "successes"
 *
 * Output: 6
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * The vowels are: 'u' (frequency 1), 'e' (frequency 2). The maximum frequency
 * is 2.
 * The consonants are: 's' (frequency 4), 'c' (frequency 2). The maximum
 * frequency is 4.
 * The output is 2 + 4 = 6.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: s = "aeiaeia"
 *
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 * The vowels are: 'a' (frequency 3), 'e' ( frequency 2), 'i' (frequency 2).
 * The maximum frequency is 3.
 * There are no consonants in s. Hence, maximum consonant frequency = 0.
 * The output is 3 + 0 = 3.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= s.length <= 100
 * s consists of lowercase English letters only.
