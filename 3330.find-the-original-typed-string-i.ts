 * Testcase Example:  '"abbcccc"'
 *
 * Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she
 * tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a
 * character being typed multiple times.
 *
 * Although Alice tried to focus on her typing, she is aware that she may still
 * have done this at most once.
 *
 * You are given a string word, which represents the final output displayed on
 * Alice's screen.
 *
 * Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have
 * intended to type.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: word = "abbcccc"
 *
 * Output: 5
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The possible strings are: "abbcccc", "abbccc", "abbcc", "abbc", and
 * "abcccc".
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: word = "abcd"
 *
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The only possible string is "abcd".
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: word = "aaaa"
 *
 * Output: 4
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= word.length <= 100
 * word consists only of lowercase English letters.
