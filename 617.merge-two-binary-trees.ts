 * Total Submissions: 1.1M
 * Testcase Example:  '[1,3,2,5]\n[2,1,3,null,4,null,7]'
 *
 * You are given two binary trees root1 and root2.
 *
 * Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the
 * two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to merge the two
 * trees into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap,
 * then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the
 * NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.
 *
 * Return the merged tree.
 *
 * Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: root1 = [1,3,2,5], root2 = [2,1,3,null,4,null,7]
 * Output: [3,4,5,5,4,null,7]
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: root1 = [1], root2 = [1,2]
 * Output: [2,2]
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 2000].
 * -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
