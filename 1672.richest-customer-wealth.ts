 *
 * You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the

 * 2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
 * Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return
 * 6.

 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * m == accounts.length
 * n == accounts[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 50
 * 1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100
