 * Testcase Example:  '[18,6,10,3]'
 *
 * Given the head of a linked list head, in which each node contains an integer
 * value.
 *
 * Between every pair of adjacent nodes, insert a new node with a value equal
 * to the greatest common divisor of them.
 *
 * Return the linked list after insertion.
 *
 * The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest positive integer
 * that evenly divides both numbers.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: head = [18,6,10,3]
 * Output: [18,6,6,2,10,1,3]
 * Explanation: The 1^st diagram denotes the initial linked list and the 2^nd
 * diagram denotes the linked list after inserting the new nodes (nodes in blue
 * are the inserted nodes).
 * - We insert the greatest common divisor of 18 and 6 = 6 between the 1^st and
 * the 2^nd nodes.
 * - We insert the greatest common divisor of 6 and 10 = 2 between the 2^nd and
 * the 3^rd nodes.
 * - We insert the greatest common divisor of 10 and 3 = 1 between the 3^rd and
 * the 4^th nodes.
 * There are no more adjacent nodes, so we return the linked list.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: head = [7]
 * Output: [7]
 * Explanation: The 1^st diagram denotes the initial linked list and the 2^nd
 * diagram denotes the linked list after inserting the new nodes.
 * There are no pairs of adjacent nodes, so we return the initial linked
 * list.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5000].
 * 1 <= Node.val <= 1000
