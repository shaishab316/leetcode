 * Testcase Example:  '[0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]'
 *
 * You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers
 * separated by 0's. The beginning and end of the linked list will have
 * Node.val == 0.
 *
 * For every two consecutive 0's, merge all the nodes lying in between them
 * into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The
 * modified list should not contain any 0's.
 *
 * Return the head of the modified linked list.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]
 * Output: [4,11]
 * Explanation:
 * The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list
 * contains
 * - The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.
 * - The sum of the nodes marked in red: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: head = [0,1,0,3,0,2,2,0]
 * Output: [1,3,4]
 * Explanation:
 * The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list
 * contains
 * - The sum of the nodes marked in green: 1 = 1.
 * - The sum of the nodes marked in red: 3 = 3.
 * - The sum of the nodes marked in yellow: 2 + 2 = 4.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * The number of nodes in the list is in the range [3, 2 * 10^5].
 * 0 <= Node.val <= 1000
 * There are no two consecutive nodes with Node.val == 0.
 * The beginning and end of the linked list have Node.val == 0.
