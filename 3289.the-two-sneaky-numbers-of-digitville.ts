 * Testcase Example:  '[0,1,1,0]'
 *
 * In the town of Digitville, there was a list of numbers called nums
 * containing integers from 0 to n - 1. Each number was supposed to appear
 * exactly once in the list, however, two mischievous numbers sneaked in an
 * additional time, making the list longer than usual.
 *
 * As the town detective, your task is to find these two sneaky numbers. Return
 * an array of size two containing the two numbers (in any order), so peace can
 * return to Digitville.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [0,1,1,0]
 *
 * Output: [0,1]
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The numbers 0 and 1 each appear twice in the array.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [0,3,2,1,3,2]
 *
 * Output: [2,3]
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The numbers 2 and 3 each appear twice in the array.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [7,1,5,4,3,4,6,0,9,5,8,2]
 *
 * Output: [4,5]
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The numbers 4 and 5 each appear twice in the array.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 2 <= n <= 100
 * nums.length == n + 2
 * 0 <= nums[i] < n
 * The input is generated such that nums contains exactly two repeated
 * elements.
