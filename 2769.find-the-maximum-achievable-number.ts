 * Testcase Example:  '4\n1'
 *
 * Given two integers, num and t. A number x is achievable if it can become
 * equal to num after applying the following operation at most t times:
 *
 *
 * Increase or decrease x by 1, and simultaneously increase or decrease num by
 * 1.
 *
 *
 * Return the maximum possible value of x.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: num = 4, t = 1
 *
 * Output: 6
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * Apply the following operation once to make the maximum achievable number
 * equal to num:
 *
 *
 * Decrease the maximum achievable number by 1, and increase num by 1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: num = 3, t = 2
 *
 * Output: 7
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * Apply the following operation twice to make the maximum achievable number
 * equal to num:
 *
 *
 * Decrease the maximum achievable number by 1, and increase num by 1.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= num, tÂ <= 50
