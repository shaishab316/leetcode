 * Testcase Example:  '"2080-02-29"'
 *
 * You are given a string date representing a Gregorian calendar date in the
 * yyyy-mm-dd format.
 *
 * date can be written in its binary representation obtained by converting
 * year, month, and day to their binary representations without any leading
 * zeroes and writing them down in year-month-day format.
 *
 * Return the binary representation of date.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: date = "2080-02-29"
 *
 * Output: "100000100000-10-11101"
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * 100000100000, 10, and 11101 are the binary representations of 2080, 02, and
 * 29 respectively.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: date = "1900-01-01"
 *
 * Output: "11101101100-1-1"
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * 11101101100, 1, and 1 are the binary representations of 1900, 1, and 1
 * respectively.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * date.length == 10
 * date[4] == date[7] == '-', and all other date[i]'s are digits.
 * The input is generated such that date represents a valid Gregorian calendar
 * date between Jan 1^st, 1900 and Dec 31^st, 2100 (both inclusive).
