 * Total Submissions: 1.3M
 * Testcase Example:  '["A","A","A","B","B","B"]\n2'
 *
 * You are given an array of CPU tasks, each labeled with a letter from A to Z,
 * and a number n. Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one
 * task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: there
 * has to be a gap of at least n intervals between two tasks with the same
 * label.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of CPU intervals required to complete all
 * tasks.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
 *
 * Output: 8
 *
 * Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A
 * -> B.
 *
 * After completing task A, you must wait two intervals before doing A again.
 * The same applies to task B. In the 3^rd interval, neither A nor B can be
 * done, so you idle. By the 4^th interval, you can do A again as 2 intervals
 * have passed.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1
 *
 * Output: 6
 *
 * Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.
 *
 * With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other
 * task.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3
 *
 * Output: 10
 *
 * Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B ->
 * idle -> idle -> A -> B.
 *
 * There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3
 * intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these
 * tasks.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= tasks.length <= 10^4
 * tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter.
 * 0 <= n <= 100
 *
